# dota2_custom_bots_test_bot_script_of_lambda
This is just me learning dota2 bot scripting. 
The folder is the "bots" folder located at "steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\dota\scripts\vscripts\bots".
I directly upload the folder to github to keep tracking the changes.

This "bots" folder is used for developing dota2 bot script locally. I found that there is little info about dota2 bot scripting on the Internet. So tring to build and test it myself sounds like a good idea for learning about dota2 bot scripting.

And about the name of the repository, I want to call it test_bot_script_of_lambda, that's why the repository has this wierd name.
